Prepare emergency means to compensate for low reliability of an object (’belt and braces’). The nervous system as a pattern analyser can extrapolate present observations to estimate the probability of future events. Organisms also have various degrees of redundancy and safety factors built in to their design to allow for failure rates in use. The failure rate is closely related to the reproductive rate of the organism - an organism which reproduces at a higher rate can afford greater loss of individuals.
