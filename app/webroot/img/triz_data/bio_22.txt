Use harmful factors (from environment as well) to achieve a positive effect; eliminate the primary harmful action by adding it to another harmful action to resolve the problem; amplify a harmful factor to such a degree that it is no longer harmful.
Many organisms respond to minor damage by increasing their growth rate; plants being eaten by insects frequently grow more quickly. Many organisms have adapted to fire so it opens up the habitat and provides a sudden influx of nutrients as the burnt material dissolves into the soil, thus effectively reducing competition from other organisms. Many plants in hot and dry environments produce aromatics which accelerate and support fire.
