Instead of continuous action, use periodic or pulsating actions; if an action is already periodic, change the magnitude or frequency of the period; use periods between actions to perform a different action. Many insects communicate using modulation of a frequency rather than changing the basic frequency - presumably this is energy-efficient. The bombardier beetle produces a pulsed stream of hot phenols and peroxide which it can squirt at its predator at high velocity. Many organisms have down-time (sleep) built in to them either for reconstitution or because the daily cycle presents times when the environment is not optimal (too hot, too cold, too dark, too light).
