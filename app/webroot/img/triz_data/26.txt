26. Copying


Instead of an unavailable, expensive, fragile object, use simpler and inexpensive copies.

- Virtual reality via computer instead of an expensive vacation
- Listen to an audio tape instead of attending a seminar.


Replace an object, or process with optical copies.

- Do surveying from space photographs instead of on the ground.
- Measure an object by measuring the photograph.
- Make sonograms to evaluate the health of a fetus, instead of risking damage by direct testing.


If visible optical copies are already used, move to infrared or ultraviolet copies.

- Make images in infrared to detect heat sources, such as diseases in crops, or intruders in a security system.
