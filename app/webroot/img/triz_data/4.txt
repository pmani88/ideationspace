4. Asymmetry


Change the shape of an object from symmetrical to asymmetrical.

- Asymmetrical mixing vessels or asymmetrical vanes in symmetrical vessels improve mixing (cement trucks, cake mixers, blenders).
- Put a flat spot on a cylindrical shaft to attach a knob securely.


If an object is asymmetrical, increase its degree of asymmetry.

- Change from circular O-rings to oval cross-section to specialized shapes to improve sealing.
- Use astigmatic optics to merge colors.
