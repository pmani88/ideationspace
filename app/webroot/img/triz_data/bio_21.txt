Conduct a process or stages of it (e.g. destructive, harmful, hazardous operations) at high speed. The basilisk lizard can run across water if it pushes its feet down fast enough (this effect is limited by scaling). It implies high rates of energy dissipation which is not usual in biology. Obviously it could be applied to escape or avoidance behaviour, and so is really  applicable only in emergency.
