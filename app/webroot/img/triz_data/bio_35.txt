Change: the physical state (e.g. to gas, liquid, or solid), concentration, density, degree of flexibility, temperature, volume, pressure or any other parameter. Oxygen is transported attached to haemoglobin, which greatly increases its ’solubility’; many animals and plants can survive being dried or frozen which enables them to live in marginal habitats; the stiffness of plants can be changed by internal pressure in cells, allowing movement. Echinoderms change the stiffness of their collagenous tissue. Most poikilothermic (’cold-blooded’) animals and many plants can control their temperature within wide limits.
