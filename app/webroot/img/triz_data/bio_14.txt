Move from straight parts of an object to the curved ones, from flat surfaces to spherical ones and from parts shaped as a  tube (parallelopiped) to ball-shaped structures; use rollers, balls, spirals; go from linear to rotary motion (or vice versa); use centrifugal force.Although there is only one rotating joint in nature, there are many examples of balls, spirals and domes, probably because they are relatively simple shapes to define (by internal pressure or by having an asymmetrical growing edge) and can produce structures which will take forces without generating shear through the thickness of the shell.
