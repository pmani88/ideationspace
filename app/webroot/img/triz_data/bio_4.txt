Change the shape or properties of an object from symmetrical to asymmetrical; change its shape to suit external asymmetries (e.g. ergonomic features); or if it is asymmetrical, increase its asymmetry. Very few biological objects are symmetrical and so are difficult to model and analyse. The asymmetry is usually a direct response to the usage or history of the object, and so represents an immediately adaptive and efficient response to function. Symmetry probably occurs in engineering only for ease of fabrication and calculation.
