31. Porous materials


Make an object porous or add porous elements (inserts, coatings, etc.).

- Drill holes in a structure to reduce the weight.
If an object is already porous, use the pores to introduce a useful substance or function.
- Use a porous metal mesh to wick excess solder away from a joint.
- Store hydrogen in the pores of a palladium sponge. (Fuel *tank* for the hydrogen car--much safer than storing hydrogen gas)
