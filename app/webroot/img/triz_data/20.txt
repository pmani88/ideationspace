20. Steady useful actions


Carry on work continuously; make all prts of an object work at full load, all the time.

- Flywheel (or hydraulic system) stores energy when a vehicle stops, so the motor can keep running at optimum power.
- Run the bottleneck operations in a factory continuously, to reach the optimum pace. (From theory of constraints, or takt time operations)


Eliminate all idle or intermittent actions or work.

- Print during the return of a printer carriage--dot matrix printer, daisy wheel printers, inkjet printers.
