Place one object inside another; place multiple objects inside others; make one part pass (dynamically) through a cavity of the other. The female aphid reproduces parthenogentically (i.e. without need of sperm). The nesting allows unborn aphids to have their offspring developing inside them, even several generations further on. The aphid can then reproduce extremely quickly when it finds itself on a good food supply, and ensures that all the individuals are genetically the same, which under these conditions ensures that they are all best adapted for that particular food source. This general principle can also be exemplified by deployable structures in insects, where many of them are made by the retraction of one segment or part inside another. Examples are stings, egg-laying tubes, tubular mouthparts.
