19. Periodic action


Instead of continuous action, use periodic or pulsating actions.

- Hitting something repeatedly with a hammer
- Replace a continuous siren with a pulsed sound.


If an action is already periodic, change the periodic magnitude or frequency.

- Use Frequency Modulation to convey information, instead of Morse code.
- Replace a continuous siren with sound that changes amplitude and frequency.


Use pauses between impulses to perform a different action.

- In cardio-pulmonary respiration (CPR) breathe after every 5 chest compressions.
