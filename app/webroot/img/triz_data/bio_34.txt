After completing their function (or becoming useless) reject objects, discard them (by dissolving, evaporating, etc.) or modify during the process; restore consumable/consumed parts of an object during operation. Cells contain an lysozyme for their dissolution and recycling; the tissues of amphibians, insects, etc are autolysed when they metamorphose; the exoskeleton of an insect can be partly dissolved for food; teeth of rodents and herbivorous insects grow continuously but are selectively worn away during feeding, so keeping a sharp edge.
