When it is necessary to perform an action with both harmful and useful effects, this should be replaced with anti-actions to control harmful effects; pre-stress in opposition to known undesirable working stresses. All non-woody plants are prestressed in tension which allows the amount of solid material in the structure to be minimised (see Principle 1). The provision of protection against the physical environment is a general property of living things - extreme examples are penguin feathers (against cold) and thick bark in eucalyptus trees which can peel off (protection against dust pollution and fire).
