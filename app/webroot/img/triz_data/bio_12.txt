If an object has to be raised or lowered, redesign the object’s environment to eliminate the need or have it performed by the environment. This comes into the general area of energy conservation, so any mechanism in which strain energy can store potential or kinetic energy for short times will be relevant. Examples are strain energy storage in locomotion, which is reduced by reducing inertia. That is why a running athlete folds his / her legs as far as possible on the recovery stroke, reducing the effective length of the leg.
