18. Use Mechanical vibration/Oscillation


Cause an object to oscillate or vibrate.

- Electric carving knife with vibrating blades


Increase its frequency (even up to the ultrasonic).

- Distribute powder with vibration.


Use an object's resonant frequency.

- Destroy gall stones or kidney stones using ultrasonic resonance.


Use piezoelectric vibrators instead of mechanical ones.

- Quartz crystal oscillations drive high accuracy clocks.


Use combined ultrasonic and electromagnetic field oscillations.

- Mixing alloys in an induction furnace
