To compensate for the weight of an object, merge it with other objects that provide lift or make it interact with the environment (use aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, buoyancy and other forces). Commonly used in locomotion (flight, swimming). Many animals are planktonic, floating in water but going up and down on a daily cycle. They do this either by active swimming or by changing their bouyancy. Many flying animals use upward currents of air (thermals, updrafts) in a similar fashion.
