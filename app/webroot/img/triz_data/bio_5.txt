Bring identical or similar objects, or operations in space, closer together (or merge them); make them contiguous or parallel. In segmented animals the nervous system is primitively divided into numbers of local units (ganglia) which tend to fuse in the more evolved members of the groups. This presumably allows faster central signal processing.
