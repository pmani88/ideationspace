23. Use Feedback


Introduce feedback (referring back, cross-checking) to improve a process or action.

- Automatic volume control in audio circuits
- Signal from gyrocompass is used to control simple aircraft autopilots.
- Statistical Process Control (SPC) -- Measurements are used to decide when to modify a process. (Not all feedback systems are automated!)
- Budgets --Measurements are used to decide when to modify a process.


If feedback is already used, change its magnitude or influence.

- Change sensitivity of an autopilot when within 5 miles of an airport.
- Change sensitivity of a thermostat when cooling vs. heating, since it uses energy less efficiently when cooling.
- Change a management measure from budget variance to customer satisfaction.
