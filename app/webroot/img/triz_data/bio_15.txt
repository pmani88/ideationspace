Change the object (or outside environment) for optimal performance at every stage of operation, make them adaptable; divide an object into parts capable of movement relative to each other; change from immobile to mobile; increase the degree of free motion. The cells generally accept only low loads from the environment and bend out of the way of high loads, or readjust in the presence of (detected) high loads. The nervous system is necessary for detection; the muscular system is necessary for the readjustment in the short term, or growth in the long term.
