Replace unavailable, complex, expensive, awkward or fragile object with simplified and inexpensive copies; replace an object, or process with optical copies or images. Employ in the course of this the change of the scale (increase of decrease copies); if visible optical copies are used, move to infrared or ultraviolet copies.

’Copying’ (reproduction) is one of the main features of a living organism. Mimicry in animals can be in the form of camouflage (copying aspects of the physical or plant environment) or warning colouration (bright colours which imitate poisonous or dangerous animals - prevalent amongst insects). Some plants mimic the physical environment (e.g. Lithops). And of course the nervous system keeps a permanently updated virtual copy of the environment in store.
