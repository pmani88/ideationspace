Perform the required change of an object in advance (totally or at least partly); arrange objects in such a way that they will come into action from the most convenient place and without losing time for their delivery. This is a pre-requisite for survival. Organisms in temperate climates are linked to the seasons, so that (for instance) mating occurs at a suitable time for the offspring to be born when there is the most food around. In the shorter term hormones prepare us for various actions (an example is adrenalin). Jet lag is an expression of this phenomenon, in that we are physiologically prepared for sleeping in addition to responding to changes in external light conditions.
