Replace a normal environment with an inert one; add neutral parts, or inert additives to an object; carry out the process in a vacuum. A similar move would be to add a protective coating, as happens when skin goes brown in the sun - the melanin absorbs the UV radiation. Many organisms can survive anaerobically, some obligate (e.g. Trichonympha which digest cellulose in termites).
