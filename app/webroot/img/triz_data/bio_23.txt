Introduce feedback to improve the process of action; if feedback is already used, change its magnitude, sign (+ or -) or influence in accordance with operating conditions. Biology is replete with feedback mechanisms since they can greatly improve the performance of a wide variety of functions which are not mechanically perfect or optimised. A particularly good example is the use of feedback in frequency analysis in the middle ear.
