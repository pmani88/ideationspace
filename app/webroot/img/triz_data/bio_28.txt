Replace a mechanical system with a sensory one; replace mechanical with optical, acoustic, or olfactory; employ electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic fields for interaction with the object; move from the static to moving, from stable in time to changing, from non-structured to structured fields; employ fields in combination with the ferro-magnetic particles.

Many organisms mark their territory - e.g. wolves urinating at strategic markers around the perimeter (smell) and the spring song of birds stakes their claim both to land and mates (sound).
