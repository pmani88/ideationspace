Move into an additional dimension, from 1D to 2D, from 2D to 3D; go from single storey or layer to multi-layered; incline an object, lay it on its side; use the other side of the object; use light falling onto the neighbouring square or onto the other side of the given square. This is readily seen as an aspect of evolution and phylogeny. More primitive organisms tend to align themselves with environmental surfaces, probably because they lack the stiffness or stability to move away from them. Mosses grow on the ground or as low mounds; only in higher plants has a stem of sufficient stiffness been developed for
the plant to raise itself off the substrate; more primitive anellids and molluscs tend to crawl along the ground, then become errant, moving in 3D.
