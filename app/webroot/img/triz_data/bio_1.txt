Divide an object into independent parts; make it sectional or able to be dismantled; increase the degree of fragmentation or segmentation Division of an ’object’ is seen in insect colonies, when groups of ants, bees or wasps act as a coherent unit when they defend the nest or swarm. Many animals are simply segmented (which probably makes them simpler to define at the genetic level) and most plants are modular (leaves, flowers, stem, root). Modern genetics shows that the underlying instructions are very similar, so that an insect’s antenna can be persuaded to develop as a leg. Ease of dismantling is seen in autotomy and abscission mechanisms (abscission), in which parts of plants and animals can be made to fall off in a controlled manner. Examples are autumnal leaf fall and loss of limbs or tail by many animals when challenged. It is a general rule when designing a structure that compressive and tensile elements should be minimised and kept separate, and that either one (usually the compressive element) if reduced to zero will allow the least amount of the other element (tensile) to be used. This is seen in animals and plants with hydrostatic skeletons (which accounts for all non-woody plants).
