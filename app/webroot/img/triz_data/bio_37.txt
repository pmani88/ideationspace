Use thermal expansion or contraction of material; use multiple materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion. Temperature is rarely a variable, but water content is, and the mechanical consequences of change in turgor can be modelled by the same maths that is used for thermal change. Plants grow through concrete using only the expansion of their cells as water is attracted in to them up an osmotic gradient; dead plant parts can move because they expand by different amounts when they absorb water.
