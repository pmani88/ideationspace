8. Use Counter-weight


To compensate for the weight of an object, merge it with other objects that provide lift.

- Inject foaming agent into a bundle of logs, to make it float better.
- Use helium balloon to support advertising signs.


To compensate for the weight of an object, make it interact with the environment (e.g. use aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, buoyancy and other forces).

- Aircraft wing shape reduces air density above the wing, increases density below wing, to create lift. (This also demonstrates Principle 4, Asymmetry.)
- Vortex strips improve lift of aircraft wings.
- Hydrofoils lift ship out of the water to reduce drag.
