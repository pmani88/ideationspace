Use flexible shells and thin films instead of 3D structures; isolate the object from its environment using flexible membranes. Non-woody plants are confined within a stiff epidermis which takes out most of the tensile forces within the structure; internal organs in animals are confined within a basement membrane; arthropods are essentially shaped from a single sheet of cuticle which is folded and expanded.
