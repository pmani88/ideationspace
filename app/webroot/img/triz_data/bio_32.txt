Change the colour or transparency of an object or its external environment; to improve visibility of things that are difficult to see, add colour or luminescent elements; change the emissive properties of an object subject to radiant heating.
Squid and cuttlefish express complex behaviours (agonism, emotion?) by controlling colour cells in their skin. They, and many fish, can change colour to blend in with the background. They can also control their reflectivity. Many pelagic animals are translucent.
