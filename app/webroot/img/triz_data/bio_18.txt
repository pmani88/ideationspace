Cause an object to oscillate or vibrate; increase its frequency; use its resonant frequency; use piezoelectric vibrators  instead of mechanical ones; combine ultrasonic and electromagnetic field oscillations. There are many examples of oscillators in nature, presumably because once the conditions for a resonant frequency have been established it is not too difficult to maintain those conditions. Resonant frequencies are also very common in the mechanical parts of a locomotory system (leg-as-pendulum) and communication (producing noise).
