Change an object’s structure, action, environment, or external influence/ impact from uniform to non-uniform; make each part of an object function in conditions most suitable for its operation; make each part of an object fulfil a different and/or complementary useful function. Each internal organ in an animal has its own micro-environment, often surrounding itself with a membrane to emphasise this separation. Any organism has to be multifunctional, even a single cell, and so is very heterogeneous. There is much to be learned here regarding the optimisation between the various functions and the optimisations involved in spatial separation and functional integration. Invertebrates tend to allow more autonomy to their internal organs which possibly makes them more robust.
